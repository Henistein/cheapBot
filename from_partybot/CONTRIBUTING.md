## Adding more commands

Fork repo, then send a pull request that which meets the following criteria:

- The script for the command must be placed into the `scripts` folder, with the
  command suffix as its filename. e.g. calling `$cheap lulz` via discord should
  call the script `lulz.py` from within the `scripts` folder.
- The script must have a `run` function, as this is what is called by the
  `bot.py` script.
- Describe your script in the README.md properly so everyone knows how to use it and what it does.
